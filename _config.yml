# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

description: >-
    The SXS project is a collaborative research effort involving multiple
    institutions. Our goal is the simulation of black holes and other extreme
    spacetimes to gain a better understanding of Relativity, and the physics of
    exotic objects in the distant cosmos.
