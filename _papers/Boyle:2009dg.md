  We study the effectiveness of stationary-phase approximated post-
  Newtonian waveforms currently used by ground-based gravitational-
  wave detectors to search for the coalescence of binary black holes
  by comparing them to an accurate waveform obtained from numerical
  simulation of an equal-mass non-spinning binary black hole inspiral,
  merger and ringdown. We perform this study for the Initial- and
  Advanced-LIGO detectors. We find that overlaps between the templates
  and signal can be improved by integrating the match filter to higher
  frequencies than used currently. We propose simple analytic
  frequency cutoffs for both Initial and Advanced LIGO, which achieve
  nearly optimal matches, and can easily be extended to unequal-mass,
  spinning systems. We also find that templates that include terms in
  the phase evolution up to 3.5 pN order are nearly always better, and
  rarely significantly worse, than 2.0 pN templates currently in use.
  For Initial LIGO we recommend a strategy using templates that
  include a recently introduced pseudo-4.0 pN term in the low-mass ($M
  \leq 35 \MSun$) region, and 3.5 pN templates allowing unphysical
  values of the symmetric reduced mass $\eta$ above this. This
  strategy always achieves overlaps within 0.3% of the optimum, for
  the data used here. For Advanced LIGO we recommend a strategy using
  3.5 pN templates up to $M=12 \MSun$, 2.0 pN templates up to $M=21
  \MSun$, pseudo-4.0 pN templates up to $65 \MSun$, and 3.5 pN
  templates with unphysical $\eta$ for higher masses. This strategy
  always achieves overlaps within 0.7% of the optimum for Advanced
  LIGO.
