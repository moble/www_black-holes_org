  Gravitational waves from precessing black-hole binaries exhibit
  features that are absent in nonprecessing systems. The most
  prominent of these is a parity-violating asymmetry that beams energy
  and linear momentum preferentially along or opposite to the orbital
  angular momentum, leading to recoil of the binary. The asymmetry
  will appear as amplitude and phase modulations at the orbital
  frequency. For strongly precessing systems, it accounts for at least
  3% amplitude modulation for binaries in the sensitivity band of
  ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, and can exceed 50% for
  massive systems. Such asymmetric features are also clearly visible
  when the waves are decomposed into modes of spin-weighted spherical
  harmonics, and are inherent in the waves themselves---rather than
  resulting from residual eccentricity in numerical simulations, or
  from mode-mixing due to precession. In particular, there is
  generically no instantaneous frame for which the mode decomposition
  will have any symmetry. We introduce a method to simplify the
  expressions for waveforms given in analytical relativity, which can
  be used to combine existing high-order waveforms for nonprecessing
  systems with expressions for the precessing contributions, leading
  to improved accuracy and a unified treatment of precessing and
  nonprecessing binaries. Using this method, it is possible to clarify
  the nature and the origins of the asymmetries and show the effects
  of asymmetry on recoils more clearly. We present post-Newtonian (PN)
  expressions for the waveform modes that include these terms,
  complete to the relative 2PN level in spin (proportional to
  $v^4/c^4$ times a certain combination of the spins). Comparing the
  results of those expressions to numerical results, we find good
  qualitative agreement. We also demonstrate how these expressions can
  be used to efficiently calculate waveforms for gravitational-wave
  astronomy.
