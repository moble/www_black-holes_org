  Spin-weighted spherical functions provide a useful tool for
  analyzing tensor-valued functions on the sphere. A tensor field can
  be decomposed into complex-valued functions by taking contractions
  with tangent vectors on the sphere and the normal to the sphere.
  These component functions are usually presented as functions on the
  sphere itself, but this requires an implicit choice of distinguished
  tangent vectors with which to contract. Thus, we may more accurately
  say that spin-weighted spherical functions are functions of both a
  point on the sphere and a choice of frame in the tangent space at
  that point. The distinction becomes extremely important when
  transforming the coordinates in which these functions are expressed,
  because the implicit choice of frame will also transform. Here, it
  is proposed that spin-weighted spherical functions should be treated
  as functions on the spin group. This approach more cleanly reflects
  the geometry involved, and allows for a more elegant description of
  the behavior of spin-weighted functions. In this form, the spin-
  weighted spherical harmonics have simple expressions as elements of
  the Wigner $\mathfrak{D}$ representations, and transformations under
  rotation are simple. Two variants of the angular-momentum operator
  are defined directly in terms of the spin group; one is the standard
  angular-momentum operator $\mathbf{L}$, while the other is shown to
  be related to the spin-raising operator $\eth$. Computer code is
  also included, providing an explicit implementation of the spin-
  weighted spherical harmonics in this form.
