  We present numerical simulations of a Kerr black hole perturbed by a
  pulse of ingoing gravitational radiation. For strong perturbations
  we find up to five concentric marginally outer trapped surfaces.
  These trapped surfaces appear and disappear in pairs, so that the
  total number of such surfaces at any given time is odd. The world
  tubes traced out by the marginally outer trapped surfaces are found
  to be spacelike during the highly dynamical regime, approaching a
  null hypersurface at early and late times. We analyze the structure
  of these marginally trapped tubes in the context of the dynamical
  horizon formalism, computing the expansion of outgoing and incoming
  null geodesics, as well as evaluating the dynamical horizon flux law
  and the angular momentum flux law. Finally, we compute the event
  horizon. The event horizon is well-behaved and approaches the
  apparent horizon before and after the highly dynamical regime. No
  new generators enter the event horizon during the simulation.
