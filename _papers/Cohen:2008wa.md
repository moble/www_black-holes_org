  Event horizons are the defining physical features of black hole
  spacetimes, and are of considerable interest in studying black hole
  dynamics. Here, we reconsider three techniques to localise event
  horizons in numerical spacetimes: integrating geodesics, integrating
  a surface, and integrating a level-set of surfaces over a volume. We
  implement the first two techniques and find that straightforward
  integration of geodesics backward in time to be most robust. We find
  that the exponential rate of approach of a null surface towards the
  event horizon of a spinning black hole equals the surface gravity of
  the black hole. In head-on mergers we are able to track quasi-normal
  ringing of the merged black hole through seven oscillations,
  covering a dynamic range of about 10^5. Both at late times (when the
  final black hole has settled down) and at early times (before the
  merger), the apparent horizon is found to be an excellent
  approximation of the event horizon. In the head-on binary black hole
  merger, only {\em some} of the future null generators of the horizon
  are found to start from past null infinity/ the others approach the
  event horizons of the individual black holes at times far before
  merger.
