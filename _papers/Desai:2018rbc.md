abstract: |
  Mergers of compact binaries containing two neutron stars (NS–NS), or
  a neutron star and a stellar mass black hole (NS–BH), are likely
  progenitors of short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). A fraction
  |${\gtrsim } 20{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$| of SGRBs is followed by
  temporally extended (≳minute-long), variable X-ray emission,
  attributed to ongoing activity of the central engine. One source of
  late-time engine activity is fall-back accretion of bound tidal
  ejecta; however, observed extended emission light curves do not
  track the naively anticipated, uninterrupted t^−5/3 power-law decay,
  instead showing a lull or gap in emission typically lasting tens of
  seconds after the burst. Here, we re-examine the impact of heating
  due to rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis on the rate
  of the fall-back accretion, using ejecta properties extracted from
  numerical relativity simulations of NS–BH mergers. Heating by the
  r-process has its greatest impact on marginally bound matter, hence
  its relevance to late-time fall-back. Depending on the electron
  fraction of the ejecta and the mass of the remnant black hole,
  r-process heating can imprint a range of fall-back behaviour,
  ranging from temporal gaps of up to tens of seconds to complete
  late-time cut-off in the accretion rate. This behaviour is robust to
  realistic variations in the nuclear heating experienced by different
  parts of the ejecta. Central black holes with masses |${\lesssim }
  3\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$| typically experience absolute cut-offs in
  the fall-back rate, while more massive |${\gtrsim } 6\!-\!8\,
  \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$| black holes instead show temporal gaps. We
  thus propose that SGRBs showing extended X-ray emission arise from
  NS–BH, rather than NS–NS, mergers. Our model implies an NS–BH merger
  detection rate by LIGO that, in steady state, is comparable to or
  greater than that of NS–NS mergers.
