  The merger dynamics of a black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binary is
  influenced by the neutron star equation of state (EoS) through the
  latter's effect on the neutron star's radius and on the character of
  the mass transfer onto the black hole. We study these effects by
  simulating a number of BHNS binaries in full general relativity
  using a mixed pseudospectral/finite difference code. We consider
  several models of the neutron star matter EoS, including Gamma=2 and
  Gamma=2.75 polytropes and the nuclear-theory based Shen EoS. For
  models using the Shen EoS, we consider two limits for the evolution
  of the composition: source-free advection and instantaneous beta-
  equilibrium. To focus on EoS effects, we fix the mass ratio to 3:1
  and the initial aligned black hole spin to a/m=0.5 for all models.
  We confirm earlier studies which found that more compact stars
  create a stronger gravitational wave signal but a smaller postmerger
  accretion disk. We also vary the EoS while holding the compaction
  fixed. All mergers are qualitatively similar, but we find signatures
  of the EoS in the waveform and in the tail and disk structures.
