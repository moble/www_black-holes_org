  The spin of black holes in black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binaries
  can have a strong influence on the merger dynamics and the
  postmerger state/ a wide variety of spin magnitudes and orientations
  are expected to occur in nature. In this paper, we report the first
  simulations in full general relativity of BHNS mergers with
  misaligned black hole spin. We vary the spin magnitude from a/m=0 to
  a/m=0.9 for aligned cases, and we vary the misalignment angle from 0
  to 80 degrees for a/m=0.5. We restrict our study to 3:1 mass ratio
  systems and use a simple Gamma-law equation of state. We find that
  the misalignment angle has a strong effect on the mass of the
  postmerger accretion disk, but only for angles greater than ~ 40
  degrees. Although the disk mass varies significantly with spin
  magnitude and misalignment angle, we find that all disks have very
  similar lifetimes ~ 100ms. Their thermal and rotational profiles are
  also very similar. For a misaligned merger, the disk is tilted with
  respect to the final black hole's spin axis. This will cause the
  disk to precess, but on a timescale longer than the accretion time.
  In all cases, we find promising setups for gamma-ray burst
  production: the disks are hot, thick, and hyperaccreting, and a
  baryon-clear region exists above the black hole.
