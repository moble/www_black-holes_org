  General relativistic simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers
  have currently been limited to low-mass black holes (less than 7
  solar mass), even though population synthesis models indicate that a
  majority of mergers might involve more massive black holes (10 solar
  mass or more). We present the first general relativistic simulations
  of black hole-neutron star mergers with 10 solar mass black holes.
  For massive black holes, the tidal forces acting on the neutron star
  are usually too weak to disrupt the star before it reaches the
  innermost stable circular orbit of the black hole. Varying the spin
  of the black hole in the range a/M = 0.5-0.9, we find that mergers
  result in the disruption of the star and the formation of a massive
  accretion disk only for large spins a/M>0.7-0.9. From these results,
  we obtain updated constraints on the ability of BHNS mergers to be
  the progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts as a function of the mass
  and spin of the black hole. We also discuss the dependence of the
  gravitational wave signal on the black hole parameters, and provide
  waveforms and spectra from simulations beginning 7-8 orbits before
  merger.
