  The Numerical INJection Analysis (NINJA) project is a collaborative
  effort between members of the numerical relativity and
  gravitational-wave astrophysics communities. The purpose of NINJA is
  to study the ability to detect gravitational waves emitted from
  merging binary black holes and recover their parameters with next-
  generation gravitational-wave observatories. We report here on the
  results of the second NINJA project, NINJA-2, which employs 60
  complete binary black hole hybrid waveforms consisting of a
  numerical portion modelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown
  stitched to a post-Newtonian portion modelling the early inspiral.
  In a "blind injection challenge" similar to that conducted in recent
  LIGO and Virgo science runs, we added 7 hybrid waveforms to two
  months of data recolored to predictions of Advanced LIGO and
  Advanced Virgo sensitivity curves during their first observing runs.
  The resulting data was analyzed by gravitational-wave detection
  algorithms and 6 of the waveforms were recovered with false alarm
  rates smaller than 1 in a thousand years. Parameter estimation
  algorithms were run on each of these waveforms to explore the
  ability to constrain the masses, component angular momenta and sky
  position of these waveforms. We also perform a large-scale monte-
  carlo study to assess the ability to recover each of the 60 hybrid
  waveforms with early Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo sensitivity
  curves. Our results predict that early Advanced LIGO and Advanced
  Virgo will have a volume-weighted average sensitive distance of
  300Mpc (1Gpc) for $10M_{\odot}+10M_{\odot}$
  ($50M_{\odot}+50M_{\odot}$) binary black hole coalescences. We
  demonstrate that neglecting the component angular momenta in the
  waveform models used in matched-filtering will result in a reduction
  in sensitivity for systems with large component angular momenta.
