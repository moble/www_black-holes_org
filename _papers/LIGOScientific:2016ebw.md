  Parameter estimates of GW150914 were obtained using Bayesian
  inference, based on three semi-analytic waveform models for binary
  black hole coalescences. These waveform models differ from each
  other in their treatment of black hole spins, and all three models
  make some simplifying assumptions, notably to neglect sub-dominant
  waveform harmonic modes and orbital eccentricity. Furthermore, while
  the models are calibrated to agree with waveforms obtained by full
  numerical solutions of Einstein’s equations, any such calibration is
  accurate only to some non-zero tolerance and is limited by the
  accuracy of the underlying phenomenology, availability, quality, and
  parameter-space coverage of numerical simulations. This paper
  complements the original analyses of GW150914 with an investigation
  of the effects of possible systematic errors in the waveform models
  on estimates of its source parameters. To test for systematic errors
  we repeat the original Bayesian analysis on mock signals from
  numerical simulations of a series of binary configurations with
  parameters similar to those found for GW150914. Overall, we find no
  evidence for a systematic bias relative to the statistical error of
  the original parameter recovery of GW150914 due to modeling
  approximations or modeling inaccuracies. However, parameter biases
  are found to occur for some configurations disfavored by the data of
  GW150914: for binaries inclined edge-on to the detector over a small
  range of choices of polarization angles, and also for eccentricities
  greater than  ∼0.05. For signals with higher signal-to-noise ratio
  than GW150914, or in other regions of the binary parameter space
  (lower masses, larger mass ratios, or higher spins), we expect that
  systematic errors in current waveform models may impact
  gravitational-wave measurements, making more accurate models
  desirable for future observations.
