  There is a significant possibility that astrophysical black holes
  with nearly-extremal spins exist. Numerical simulations of such
  systems require suitable initial data. In this paper, we examine
  three methods of constructing binary-black-hole initial data,
  focusing on their ability to generate black holes with
  nearly-extremal spins: (i) Bowen-York initial data, including
  standard puncture data (based on conformal flatness and Bowen-York
  extrinsic curvature), (ii) standard quasi-equilibrium initial data
  (based on the extended-conformal- thin-sandwich equations, conformal
  flatness, and maximal slicing), and (iii) quasi- equilibrium data
  based on the superposition of Kerr-Schild metrics. We find that the
  two conformally-flat methods (i) and (ii) perform similarly, with
  spins up to about 0.99 obtainable at the initial time. However, in
  an evolution, we expect the spin to quickly relax to a significantly
  smaller value around 0.93 as the initial geometry relaxes. For
  quasi- equilibrium superposed Kerr-Schild (SKS) data [method (iii)],
  we construct initial data with <em>initial</em> spins as large as
  0.9997. We evolve SKS data sets with spins of 0.93 and 0.97 and find
  that the spin drops by only a few parts in 10<sup>4</sup> during the
  initial relaxation; therefore, we expect that SKS initial data will
  allow evolutions of binary black holes with relaxed spins above
  0.99. [Abstract abbreviated; full abstract also mentions several
  secondary results.]
