  Astrophysically realistic black holes may have spins that are nearly
  extremal (i.e., close to 1 in dimensionless units). Numerical
  simulations of binary black holes are important tools both for
  calibrating analytical templates for gravitational-wave detection
  and for exploring the nonlinear dynamics of curved spacetime.
  However, all previous simulations of binary-black-hole inspiral,
  merger, and ringdown have been limited by an apparently
  insurmountable barrier: the merging holes' spins could not exceed
  0.93, which is still a long way from the maximum possible value in
  terms of the physical effects of the spin. In this paper, we surpass
  this limit for the first time, opening the way to explore
  numerically the behavior of merging, nearly extremal black holes.
  Specifically, using an improved initial-data method suitable for
  binary black holes with nearly extremal spins, we simulate the
  inspiral (through 12.5 orbits), merger and ringdown of two equal-
  mass black holes with equal spins of magnitude 0.95 antialigned with
  the orbital angular momentum.
