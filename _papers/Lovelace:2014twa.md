  The spin angular momentum S of an isolated Kerr black hole is
  bounded by the surface area A of its apparent horizon: $8\pi
  S\leqslant A$, with equality for extremal black holes. In this
  paper, we explore the extremality of individual and common apparent
  horizons for merging, rapidly spinning binary black holes. We
  consider simulations of merging black holes with equal masses M and
  initial spin angular momenta aligned with the orbital angular
  momentum, including new simulations with spin magnitudes up to
  $S/{{M}^{2}}=0.994$. We measure the area and (using approximate
  Killing vectors) the spin on the individual and common apparent
  horizons, finding that the inequality $8\pi S\lt A$ is satisfied in
  all cases but is very close to equality on the common apparent
  horizon at the instant it first appears. We also evaluate the
  Booth–Fairhurst extremality, whose value for a given apparent
  horizon depends on the scaling of the horizon’s null normal vectors.
  In particular, we introduce a gauge-invariant lower bound on the
  extremality by computing the smallest value that Booth and
  Fairhurst’s extremality parameter can take for any scaling. Using
  this lower bound, we conclude that the common horizons are at least
  moderately close to extremal just after they appear. Finally,
  following Lovelace et al (2008 Phys. Rev. D 78 084017), we construct
  quasiequilibrium binary-black hole initial data with ‘overspun’
  marginally trapped surfaces with $8\pi S\gt A$. We show that the
  overspun surfaces are indeed superextremal: our lower bound on their
  Booth–Fairhurst extremality exceeds unity. However, we confirm that
  these superextremal surfaces are always surrounded by marginally
  outer trapped surfaces (i.e., by apparent horizons) with $8\pi S\lt
  A$. The extremality lower bound on the enclosing apparent horizon is
  always less than unity but can exceed the value for an extremal Kerr
  black hole.
