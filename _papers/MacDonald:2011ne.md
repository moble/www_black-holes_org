  This article presents a study of the sufficient accuracy of post-
  Newtonian and numerical relativity waveforms for the most demanding
  usage case: parameter estimation of strong sources in advanced
  gravitational wave detectors. For black hole binaries, these
  detectors require accurate waveform models which can be constructed
  by fusing an analytical post-Newtonian inspiral waveform with a
  numerical relativity merger-ringdown waveform. We perform a
  comprehensive analysis of errors that enter such "hybrid waveforms".
  We find that the post-Newtonian waveform must be aligned with the
  numerical relativity waveform to exquisite accuracy, about 1/100 of
  a gravitational wave cycle. Phase errors in the inspiral phase of
  the numerical relativity simulation must be controlled to less than
  about 0.1rad. (These numbers apply to moderately optimistic
  estimates about the number of GW sources; exceptionally strong
  signals require even smaller errors.) The dominant source of error
  arises from the inaccuracy of the investigated post-Newtonian
  Taylor-approximants. Using our error criterium, even at 3.5-th post-
  Newtonian order, hybridization has to be performed significantly
  before the start of the longest currently available numerical
  waveforms which cover 30 gravitational wave cycles. The current
  investigation is limited to the equal-mass, zero-spin case and does
  not take into account calibration errors of the gravitational wave
  detectors.
