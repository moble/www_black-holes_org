  We test the resummation techniques used in developing Padé and
  Effective One Body (EOB) waveforms for gravitational wave
  detection. Convergence tests show that Padé approximants of the
  gravitational wave energy flux do not accelerate the convergence of
  the standard Taylor approximants even in the test mass limit, and
  there is no reason why Padé transformations should help in
  estimating parameters better in data analysis. Moreover, adding a
  pole to the flux seems unnecessary in the construction of these
  Padé-approximated flux formulas. Padé approximants may be useful in
  suggesting the form of fitting formulas. We compare a 15-orbit
  numerical waveform of the Caltech-Cornell group to the suggested
  Padé waveforms of Damour et al. in the equal mass, nonspinning
  quasi-circular case. The comparison suggests that the Padé waveforms
  do not agree better with the numerical waveform than the standard
  Taylor based waveforms. Based on this result, we design a simple EOB
  model by modifiying the ET EOB model of Buonanno et al., using the
  Taylor series of the flux with an unknown parameter at the fourth
  post-Newtonian order that we fit for. This simple EOB model
  generates a waveform having a phase difference of only 0.002 radians
  with the numerical waveform, much smaller than 0.04 radians the
  phase uncertainty in the numerical data itself. An EOB Hamiltonian
  can make use of a Padé transformation in its construction, but this
  is the only place Padé transformations seem useful.
