  The stability of rotating black holes in dynamical Chern-Simons
  gravity (dCS) is an open question. To study this issue, we evolve
  the leading-order metric perturbation in order-reduced dynamical
  Chern-Simons gravity. The source is the leading-order dCS scalar
  field coupled to the spacetime curvature of a rotating black hole
  background. We use a well-posed, constraint-preserving scheme. We
  find that the leading-order metric perturbation numerically exhibits
  linear growth, but that the level of this growth converges to zero
  with numerical resolution. This analysis shows that spinning black
  holes in dCS gravity are numerically stable to leading-order
  perturbations in the metric.
