  We present the first attempt at calibrating the effective-one-body
  (EOB) model to accurate numerical-relativity simulations of
  spinning, non-precessing black-hole binaries. Aligning the EOB and
  numerical waveforms at low frequency over a time interval of 1000M,
  we first estimate the phase and amplitude errors in the numerical
  waveforms and then minimize the difference between numerical and EOB
  waveforms by calibrating a handful of EOB-adjustable parameters. In
  the equal-mass, spin aligned case, we find that phase and fractional
  amplitude differences between the numerical and EOB (2,2) mode can
  be reduced to 0.01 radians and 1%, respectively, over the entire
  inspiral waveforms. In the equal-mass, spin anti-aligned case, these
  differences can be reduced to 0.13 radians and 1% during inspiral
  and plunge, and to 0.4 radians and 10% during merger and
  ringdown. The waveform agreement is within numerical errors in the
  spin aligned case while slightly over numerical errors in the spin
  anti-aligned case. Using Enhanced LIGO and Advanced LIGO noise
  curves, we find that the overlap between the EOB and the numerical
  (2,2) mode, maximized over the initial phase and time of arrival, is
  larger than 0.999 for binaries with total mass 30M⊙-200M⊙. In
  addition to the leading (2,2) mode, we compare four subleading
  modes. We find good amplitude and frequency agreements between the
  EOB and numerical modes for both spin configurations considered,
  except for the (3,2) mode in the spin anti-aligned case. We believe
  that the larger difference in the (3,2) mode is due to the lack of
  knowledge of post-Newtonian spin effects in the higher modes.
