  The first spectral numerical simulations of 16 orbits, merger, and
  ringdown of an equal-mass non-spinning binary black hole system are
  presented. Gravitational waveforms from these simulations have
  accumulated numerical phase errors through ringdown of ~0.1 radian
  when measured from the beginning of the simulation, and ~0.02 radian
  when waveforms are time and phase shifted to agree at the peak
  amplitude. The waveform seen by an observer at infinity is
  determined from waveforms computed at finite radii by an
  extrapolation process accurate to ~0.01 radian in phase. The phase
  difference between this waveform at infinity and the waveform
  measured at a finite radius of r=100M is about half a radian. The
  ratio of final mass to initial mass is M_f/M = 0.95162 +- 0.00002,
  and the final black hole spin is S_f/M_f^2=0.68646 +- 0.00004.
