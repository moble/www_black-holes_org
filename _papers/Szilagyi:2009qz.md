  Several improvements in numerical methods and gauge choice are
  presented that make it possible now to perform simulations of the
  merger and ringdown phases of "generic" binary black-hole evolutions
  using the pseudo-spectral evolution code SpEC. These improvements
  include the use of a new damped-wave gauge condition, a new grid
  structure with appropriate filtering that improves stability, and
  better adaptivity in conforming the grid structures to the shapes
  and sizes of the black holes. Simulations illustrating the success
  of these new methods are presented for a variety of binary black-
  hole systems. These include fairly ``generic'' systems with unequal
  masses (up to 2:1 mass ratios), and spins (with magnitudes up to 0.4
  M^2) pointing in various directions.
