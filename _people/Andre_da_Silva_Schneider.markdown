##### Research Projects

Calculate equations of state of nuclear matter using general Skyrme parametrizations.  Simulation of
accretion induced collapse of white dwarfs into neutron stars.

##### Biography

I have a bachelor and a master's degree in Physics from the Federal University of Santa Catarina
(UFSC) in Brazil. At UFSC I worked with Prof. Ricardo Marinelli obtaining nucleon wave-functions in
nuclei to calculate cross sections of electron-nuclei scattering. Later I worked in the University
of Coimbra in Portugal with Prof. Constança Providência calculating equations of state for hybrid
neutron stars. After that I went to Indiana University where I obtained a Ph.D. degree in 2013 and
worked as a Postdoctoral scholar in 2014. In Indiana I worked with Prof. Charles Horowitz on
molecular dynamics simulations of dense plasmas and nuclear pasta. In October 2014 I moved to
Caltech where I study equations of state of nuclear matter and accretion induced collapse of white
dwarfs into neutron stars.
