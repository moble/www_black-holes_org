##### Research Projects

Exploring various aspects of exoplanet formation and dynamics, such as the origin of spin-orbit
misalignment in Hot Jupiter systems.

##### Biography

I graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara with a B.S. in Physics in Spring 2009.
During my time there, I worked with Professor Omer Blaes on the physics of black hole accretion
discs. I received my Ph.D. in Physics from Cornell University in 2015. I was advised by Professor
Dong Lai and worked on several topics in compact object astrophysics and exoplanet astrophysics. I
am currently a Sherman Fairchild Postdoctoral Scholar at Caltech.
