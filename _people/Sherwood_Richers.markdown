supernova gravitational wave signal on the nuclear equation of state

##### Biography

I received my bachelor's degree in Astronomy-Physics at the University of Virginia in 2012 before
starting my graduate studies in the TAPIR group at Caltech. My current research efforts are focused
on understanding aspects of highly-energetic supernovae and gamma-ray bursts through GRMHD
simulations of the fluid and Monte Carlo simulations of neutrino transport. Since joining TAPIR I
have earned my private pilot's license, and I try to fly as often as possible, sometimes inverted.
